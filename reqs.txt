Import and organize images and videos from a camera SD card into a folder on a computer. They must be organized as follows:
- Images and videos are sorted separately.
- Videos are stored in a subfolder named after the date of capture.
- Images are stored in a subfolder named after the date of capture and session. Here, a session is defined as a series of consecutive images where the time difference between them is less than a user-specified number of hours (default 3 hours).
- Sessions that start before 2 PM are considered morning sessions, and sessions that start after 2 PM are considered afternoon sessions. When naming the subfolders, append "-AM" for morning sessions and "-PM" for afternoon sessions after the date. Append "-" and an integer if there are multiple morning session, and do the same for afternoon session (resetting to 1).
- Append ".ORF" to the end of ORI file names.
- If a JPEG file shares the same name as an ORF file, then the JPEG file should be sorted into a separate subfolder for later deletion. Include a relative symbolic link to the ORF file in the JPEG subfolder to allow the user to easily compare with the original image.
- Show the user the progress of the script.
- Count the number of image and video files in the input folder before starting, and count the number of image and video files in the output folder after finishing. Print the counts to the console and raise an error if any files are missing.
- Ensure that you use a package that can handle ORF files, which is the RAW format for Olympus cameras.
- Note that ORI files are actually ORF files with a different extension.
